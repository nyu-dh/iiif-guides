# IIIF FAQ

**How do rights and permissions work with IIIF reuse?**
Reuse rights are decided by the institution and embedded within the metadata. Authenticator APIs can be utilized for limited access content.

**When should I implement IIIF?**
Institutions can implement IIIF in their collections at any time once there is digitized content. JPGs, JPEG 2000, .tiff, along with audio and video content can be translated into IIIF standards.
