# iiif-guides

Welcome to NYU's DSS Guide for [IIIF](https://iiif.io)! 📚

Here you'll find resources about what IIIF is, who could benefit from it, and how to start using IIIF. IIIF, or the International Image Interoperability Framework, is a way of displaying content on the web that allows for richer display, better integrated metadata, and easier moving between software.

This guide is intended to be a fully self-enclosed guide. While there will be links to other resources, the goal of this guide is to provide a simple, but thorough understanding of IIIF (without needing a million tabs open).
