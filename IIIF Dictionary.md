| IIIF              | International Image Interoperability Framework                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| IIIF Link         | A special URL that connects an image URL with the additional JSON context that makes an image IIIF compliant. These links often end with /*info.json* or /*manifest.json*. When opened in a web browser, it should appear as JSON code, _not_ the image itself                                                                                                 |
| IIIF Image        | an Image that is can be made available through an IIIF Image API Server. Can usually be identified with the /info.json file name                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| IIIF Manifest     | a collection of 1+ IIIF images with additional metadata in the JSON file. Can usually be identified with the /manifest.json file name                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Server            | Software that runs on a machine at all times and is accessible over the Web. Sometimes they are also know as Services e.g. Image API service, Web Service or Mail Service.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Image Server      | Software that specializes in providing access to images                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| API               | Application Programming Interface. In this case an agreed standard between the Image API Server and the Image API Client.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Image API         | A web service that returns content in response to a standard HTTP/HTTPs request. The Image API is what allows for image delivery, manipulation, and reuse                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Presentation API  | the compounding of multiple digital objects (images, audio, video), with additional metadata for how to display images, and descriptive information about the object                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Metadata          | Data that contextualizes content. This could include the institution it is held at, when it was created, the rights associated with it, alternate text for an image, etc                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Annotations       | Notes, transcriptions, or comments that are directly embedded onto an image. The annotations (typically) do not affect the "base" file, but can be transported from software to software.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Level 0 Image     | Usually a converted smaller file, like a standard .jpg, that is enough for a zoomable viewer, but has a limited number of sizes and regions defined due to the size of the file.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Canvas            | A single image/page as part of a larger IIIF Manifest (From IIIF: the frame of reference for the display of your content, both spatial and temporal (just like a painting canvas for two-dimensional materials, or with an added time dimension for a/v content).)                                                                                             |
| Tiling            | The breakdown of an image into different tiles that define regions and allow for zooming in an Image API. See [IIIF Quick-Start Guide](IIIF Quick Start Guide.md)                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| JSON              | JavaScript Object Notation, a human-readable format that holds the metadata and extra information about how to order or display content                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Content           | Files that are currently supported by IIIF. Typically, this refers to image files, but IIIF has expanded to include capability for audio and video resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| URI Syntax        | The way that the Image API interacts with an HTTP(S) request. It is a standardized template that allows for image manipulation. It follows this structure: **{scheme}://{server}{/prefix}/{identifier}/{region}/{size}/{rotation}/{quality}.{format}**, in practice, this may look like:  **https://example.org/image-service/abcd1234/full/max/0/default.jpg**        |
| HTTP/HTTPS        | The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is what is used to load pages on the internet using hyperlinks. You can see it at the very beginning ina link on a web browser. HTTPS is similar, but provides encryption, making it more secure. Importantly, in the IIIF context, the link format must be the same as the server, or the request may return an error  |
