# Who should use IIIF?

Developers, librarians, researchers, archivists, writers, museum workers, everyone ;) 

two buckets of using IIIF:

- Implementers → turning content into IIIF compliant files
- End users (researchers) → ppl who use manifests for research, websites, etc


**From IIIF: [Why IIIF](https://iiif.io/get-started/why-iiif/)**

**Rich image delivery**
Fast, rich zoom & pan delivery of images via the Internet, with options for size, scale, region of interest, rotation, quality and format.

**Plug and play software**
Use any IIIF-compatible software for viewing, comparing and manipulating images from any IIIF-compatible image site, regardless of the back-end server. Swap parts of the stack at any time, or run multiple components in parallel at once.

**Publish once, reuse often**
Deliver images from your own site for many uses; host a single copy and embed in other sites. No need to transfer images to others for them to locally load and use them for one off analysis or republishing.

**Remix Content**
Assemble and reuse IIIF resources from across the Web, regardless of source. Compare pages, import into tools, build exhibits, or view items served from different sites in one place.

**Annotate**
IIIF has native compatibility with the W3C Web Annotation model, which supports annotating content on the Web. Comment on, transcribe, and mark up resources using the Web’s inherent architecture–even for Audiovisual resources.

**Cite and Share**
IIIF APIs give portable views onto images or any of its regions, and provide incentive for URIs that persist through image server migrations. Cite an image with a stable URI, or share it for reference by others–or yourself in a different environment.

**Global Network**
Join a global network of image suppliers making content available in a common framework. Tap a growing suite of software tools and platforms. Maximize the use of your images on the Web. Unlock new potential with interoperability. Bring together content from multiple sources (organizational and technical)

*^ a lot of this language could be be better/simpler

 & also: 
 
 - trace the image back to the original creator/owner

- follow the thread of rights/ownership

- simplifies citations

- removes need to endlessly download + reupload images, add credit, etc because they are all included in the metadata "wrapper"
