# IIIF Survey

## Intro
- Your name 
- Your email
- Your affiliation (institution)
- Your role (researcher, faculty, student)

## Content interaction 
- How often do you interact with content (images, video, audio; including manuscripts, maps, recorded interviews) on the web for your research? (scale rarely - very often)
- How often do you upload content on the web for your research? 
- How often do you include content in publications or writing for your research?
- How do you engage with content on the web? 
  - Interacting directly through a museum/archive/library's website
  - Downloading content and opening it in a separate application 
  - Hosting locally on your computer (not uploaded online)
  - Other 

## IIIF benefits
- How useful would it be if content hosted on the web... (scale not at all useful - very useful)
    - Had embedded metadata that would move with the content (source institution, author, date, etc) to make citing easier 
    - Could be moved into different software online without having to download the image
    - Could be annotated online (for notes, comments, context, or transcription)
    - Could be compiled as a set from multiple different institutions (pages of manuscripts, sections of maps)
    - Had deep zoom capabilities (able to zoom in very close to the image)
    - Could be manipulated (cropped, rotated, size-adjusted) without having to download the image

- What, if anything, do you struggle with when interacting with content on the web? (having to download the source, citations, etc)
